# Cryptocurrency

This project focuses on analyzing the cryptocurrency market to create a classification system for a new investment portfolio. The analysis is divided into four parts:

Part 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA - In this section, the data is cleaned, scaled, and prepared for Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

Part 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA - The high-dimensional dataset is reduced to a lower-dimensional dataset using PCA, which allows for easier interpretation and visualization of the data.

Part 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means - Using the reduced dataset, K-means clustering is performed to group the cryptocurrencies into clusters based on their similarities.

Part 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results - Finally, the results of the clustering analysis are visualized using 3D scatter plots, which allow for easy visualization and interpretation of the clusters.

Overall, this project demonstrates the application of unsupervised machine learning techniques such as PCA and clustering to the analysis of cryptocurrency data. The results can be used to create a classification system for a new investment portfolio in the cryptocurrency market.
